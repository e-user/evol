evol - entrenched virtues of lisp / love reversed
=================================================
OK, there is not really much code here and only sometimes I find the spare time
to continue my coding but the goal of this project is to provide an
autotools-compatible (entrenching!) tool (or set of tools) that is able to
replace the autotools without repeating errors made by other projects with
similar ambitions.
