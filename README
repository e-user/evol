evol - entrenched virtues of lisp / love reversed
=================================================
evol aims to be a compatible and full-fledged replacement for the GNU Autotools[1]
stack targeted at coping with the Autotools' shortcomings while not repeating
the mistakes made and still being made at comparable build tool projects.

evol is completely written in Common Lisp and licensed under the
GPLv3+[2]. Please see the file COPYING in the top-level directory of the
distribution tarball or see the link at [2] if you didn't receive a copy along
with this file.

Since distribution in binary form requires static linking of Common Lisp
libraries, distribution *must* include the file CREDITS also found in mentioned
top-level directory to respect copyright of the respective holders.


Alpha-Stage Warning
===================
evol is still a moving target, i.e. subject to change in terms of its top-level
API so please don't use it for any production work yet.
However you are very welcome to test and contribute!


Installation
============
Please see file INSTALL.
