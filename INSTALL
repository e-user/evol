Dependencies
============
At the time of writing, the current set of dependencies for building and/or
hacking evol is:

Foundation:
- SBCL             | http://sbcl.sourceforge.net/
- A Bourne-compatible shell, e.g. GNU Bash

CL libraries (all asdf-install:able):
- Alexandria       | http://common-lisp.net/project/alexandria/
- external-program | http://www.cliki.net/external-program
- CL-FAD           | http://www.cliki.net/CL-FAD
- CL-PPCRE         | http://www.cliki.net/CL-PPCRE
- optparser        | http://www.cliki.net/optparser
- Bordeaux-Threads | http://www.cliki.net/Bordeaux-Threads
- patron           | http://www.cliki.net/patron
- Stefil           | http://common-lisp.net/project/stefil/

Your distribution might provide some of these libraries but the names may
differ, i.e. try to search for the libraries' names prefixed with `cl-` if not
already present.

While it is possible to start evol through a trampoline using sh and sbcl it is
meant to be built and distributed as a standalone executable (please see below),
in this case no dependencies but the most fundamental ones provided by the OS
apply.


Basic Installation
==================
Execute bootstrap.sh in the top-level directory of the extracted distribution
tarball (or source code repository checkout). If everything goes well, you'll be
presented a self-executable binary named `evol` in the same directory.
